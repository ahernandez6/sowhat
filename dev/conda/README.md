This folder contains the current conda install files for dependenceis
This is a work in progress - currently does not work
The original plan was to create a conda install system
And then we could hopefully use that to create docker container as well

From Mark Howison: if this works, install would happen with the command:

conda create -n sowhat -c dunnlab sowhat
