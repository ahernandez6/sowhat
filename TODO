* Under Linux, I am getting an error in Statistics::R related to a flag sent to R (--gui=none). My fix was to 
  remove the command-line switch from the system call to R in 'Statistics/R/Bridge/Linux.pm'
  We need to at least warn users. Probably should write the author(s) of Statistics::R
  Not sure if this affects other versions
  
* Eat MOAR Twizzlers

* Allow for comparison of two suboptimal hypotheses rather than most likely topology vs. a single alternative.

* Come up with a way to start and stop runs

* Add support for threads (multiCPU)

* true support for multistate. Will require running seq-gen in aminoacid mode and up to 20 substitutions.
  - multistate currently fails with: "expecting 2 frequencies. Multi-State only works w/binary matrix"

* add in hash which checks the model - warns about unsupported model

* add in documentation about using local::lib - bootstrapping the package in and using that to cpan R

* need to check that constraint tree, dataset share taxa - names are consistent. The error that currently is output is a confusing message from RAxML.

* print $DIR/sowh_trace_$name.txt with output similar to phylobayes .trace files
