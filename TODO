* add in hash which checks the model

*** I think the warning about reduced reps is incorrect now, because it is always 99, not the full 100. I am not sure. We need to verify this.

* need to check that constraint tree, dataset share taxa - names are consistent. The error that currently is output is a confusing message from RAxML.

* in cases where seq-gen produces 2 of the same sequences in a dataset
  there will be a failure in RAxML. Should we test for duplicate generated
  seqs? will this slow down? DONE: Perhaps just a more informative warning
  message explaining the errors?

* change all hypotheses to t1, t2, in published. Tidy up published directories, example directories.

* print $DIR/sowh_info_$name.txt with all output

* print $DIR/sowh_trace_$name.txt with output similar to phylobayes .trace files

  #cycle  #treegen        time    loglik  length  alpha   nmode   stat

* run consel on cnidarian Hox analyses

* print the command line that was run to standard output straight away 
  or at least upon death
